# Quizae

## Room for Improvements

Some domains are completely unnecessary and could be removed / consolidated (e.g. simplification of presentation layer).

## Running Quizae

The whole app is containerized, and can be run locally in Docker. Take a look at `docker-compose.yaml` file for local setup, or pull the production image and run it locally.
